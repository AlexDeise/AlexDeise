## More About Me

-There is a lot more to me than software development, I am also interested in Astrophotography, Bicycling, Photography, and Snowboarding!

-I graduated from University of Pittsburgh in 2013 with a Bachelors in Biology / Chemistry. I spent 8 years working in a research lab for the Pathology Department at Pitt, I am now transitioning my career from academic research to software development. 

-I initially became interested in software as a career a few years ago whenever I had the opportunity to take courses at University of Pittsburgh where I worked full time in a research lab. One of my first courses was a basic web programming course where I learned HTML/CSS/JS to create static web pages, the first site I created was to showcase some of my photography to family and friends. Many interations later it now serves as my personal development portofolio and photography portfolio. I took several more courses in computer science at Pitt until the scheduling conflicted with my full time job, however I still continued to learn on my own through various internet resources (FreeCodeCamp, HackerRank, YouTubeand Udemy to name a few)

-I attended a Full Time Java Web Development Bootcamp in Sept. 21 at Tech Elevator to puruse my goal of becoming a full time software developer. While at Tech Elevator I was exposed to Full Stack development mainly using Java, Spring Boot, Postgres, and Vue.js. During that time I had several capstone projects that soldified my skills in object oriented programming, Unit Testing, Database Design, and how to work in an Agile work environment.
